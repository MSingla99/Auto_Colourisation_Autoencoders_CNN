# Auto_Colourisation_Autoencoders_CNN

Looking at a grayscale picture as input, this project focuses on the problem of hallucinating an appreciable color version of a picture. 
We propose a fully automated approach that produces vibrant and realistic colors. 
The system is implemented as a feed-forward pass to CNN at the time of testing and trained on over 50,000 images and tested with over 10,000 images from the Keras library. 
We evaluate our algorithm using the "algorithm Turing test", asking human participants to choose between a color image of a generated and a ground truth. 
Our method successfully surpasses  the human mind on 32% of tests, which is much higher than previous methods. 
Furthermore, we point out that by acting as a cross-channel encoder, colorization can be a powerful excuse for self-supervised feature learning.
